# DevOps Internship - Task 6: Host a Static Website with GitHub Pages

This repository contains the source code for a simple static website, deployed as part of Task 6 for the DevOps Internship program by Elevate Labs in association with the Ministry of MSME, Govt. of India.

## 📜 Objective

The primary objective of this task was to learn the fundamentals of web deployment by hosting a simple static HTML/CSS website using GitHub Pages. This demonstrates a basic CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) workflow where changes pushed to the repository are automatically deployed to the live website.

## 🚀 Live Demo

The successfully deployed website can be accessed via the following link:

**URL:** `https://pavanyarrapragada03.github.io/devops-intern-task-6`

## 🛠️ Technology Stack & Tools

* **HTML5:** For the basic structure and content of the website.
* **CSS3:** For styling the website.
* **Git:** For version control and tracking changes locally.
* **GitHub:** For hosting the remote repository.
* **GitHub Pages:** For building and deploying the website from the repository.

## ⚙️ Deployment Process

The website was deployed following these key steps:

1.  **Local Development:** Created an `index.html` file for the webpage content and a `style.css` file for the styling.
2.  **Version Control Setup:**
    * Initialized a local Git repository using `git init`.
    * Staged and committed the project files.
3.  **GitHub Repository:**
    * Created a new public repository on GitHub named `devops-intern-task-6`.
    * Connected the local repository to the remote GitHub repository.
    * Pushed the local `main` branch to GitHub using `git push`.
4.  **GitHub Pages Configuration:**
    * Navigated to the repository's `Settings > Pages` section.
    * Set the deployment source to **"Deploy from a branch"**.
    * Selected the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder as the source.
5.  **Deployment:** GitHub Pages automatically detected the changes, built the site, and deployed it to the public URL.

## ✅ Outcome

This task provided hands-on experience in:
* Using Git and GitHub for source code management.
* Understanding the process of deploying static web content.
* Leveraging GitHub Pages as a free and efficient hosting solution.
